# To use this requirements file: (assumes you want virtualenv at ../pyenv)
#
#     pip -E ../pyenv install -r pip-requirements.txt
#
# NB: if you to use site-packages you should create a virtualenv
# environment first (pip automatically does --no-site-packages)

# Can also check these out locally
# You would then replace with local checkout path e.g.
# -e local-install-path
-e .
-e hg+https://bitbucket.org/okfn/shksprdata#egg=shksprdata

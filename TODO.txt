0. 2006-04-23: Make clean shakespeare
  * DONE 2006-04-04

1. 2006-04-23: Default sort by title
  * DONE 2006-04-25

2. Javascript type table to allow sorting of table by different columns
  * for example can sort concordance by word or by occurrence
  * p: low

3. show shakespeare text side by side

4. shakespeare search
  * crude regex would be sufficient 

5. About page listing sources (?) 
  * this should be part of the source distribution and should just be autoconverted

6. Normalize titles in case of King plays (either should have King or should not). Folio does not have King.

7. concordance
  1. digrams and trigrams

8. check out moby (xml-marked-up) shakespeare and see if we can use it

9. Write webunit tests

10. Move to database storage?

11. concordance should show word sources in text and link through to text source

Questions
=========

1. Do we store data in subversion so the package is 'all in one'?
  * i.e. what is the real source?
  * i think the source should be local but a mechanism should be provided to periodically check for updates (e.g. to gutenberg stuff)

2. If do this (ie. store source in svn) do we still store the build scripts?

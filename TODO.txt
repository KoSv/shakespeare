0. Make clean shakespeare
1. Default sort by title (DONE)
2. Javascript type table to allow sorting by name
  * p: low
3. show shakespeare text side by side
4. shakespeare search
5. About page listing sources (?) 
  * this should be part of the source distribution and should just be autoconverted
6. Normalize titles in case of King plays (either should have King or should not). Folio does not have King.

Questions
=========

1. Do we store data in subversion so the package is 'all in one'?
  * i.e. what is the real source?
  * i think the source should be local but a mechanism should be provided to periodically check for updates (e.g. to gutenberg stuff)

2. If do this (ie. store source in svn) do we still store the build scripts?
